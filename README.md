The "Profit and Sales Analysis Dashboard" Microsoft Excel project involved cleaning and preparing the dataset by removing blanks, nulls,
unwanted columns, and duplicates, and correcting data types. The main measures used for analysis were sales, quantity, discount, and profit.

The project included the development of a dynamic dashboard with calculated fields, layouts, and custom charts and maps. The charts and maps used for visualization
included a combo chart displaying sales and profit, a pie chart showing Total sales by category, a line graph chart illustrating total profit by year,
and a clustered bar chart presenting customer classification.

The project also involved formatting the dashboard to enhance visual appeal and facilitate data interpretation.

The ultimate goal was to provide insights into sales and profit trends, monitor key metrics, and identify opportunities for improvement.
The dynamic nature of the dashboard allowed it to adapt to newly added data, ensuring up-to-date analysis.

Overall, the "Profit and Sales Analysis Dashboard" project utilized data from Udemy to create an interactive and informative tool for
analyzing sales and profit in the context of various dimensions and metrics.
